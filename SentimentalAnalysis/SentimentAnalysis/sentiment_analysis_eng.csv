"Be mindful when purchasing USED products.While they go above and beyond in the marketing of the device “factory re-manufactured” and “certified pre-owned” and ETC are all fancy wording for SECOND HAND, and USED.That said, with high hopes I purchased this device in May 2024 for my birthday, everything seemed to work fine, even though I noticed that the Maximum Battery Capacity was below 90%. —- Now in late January 2025 roughly only 8 months of use and the MBC has fallen to 77%, which has shown extreme degradation in that it cannot hold a charge.In addition, I have noticed that the touch screen is intermittent-Meaning that sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not. Sometimes no have to press multiple times and extremely firm—Note that all softer is up to day on the iOS, as well as the Apps used.Also note that I have equipped this phone with a highend sturdy case, which has kept it well protected, although it has not suffered any falls or drops of any kind.Additionally, the screen is and has been protected and covered since the day I received the phone and it still intact with NO cracks or scratches —-All that said, aside from the disappointment of the battery not being at 99% when received and now not holding a charge through the day even with a mid day recharge, I am surprised that I could not get to at least a full 2 years before minor or even major hardware degradation had set in.The question then lies with the company who is selling the phones vs the Apple product itself.I can say ALL my Apple iPhone devices have held the test of time and I’ve never had to upgrade due to hardware, but due to obsoletion.

Phone came looking somewhat new except for a few minor scratches around the edges of the screen and the speaker sounded really bad until I noticed they were very dirty and had to clean them out with a pin myself.Come on Amazon if you're gonna sell stuff under a premium condition listing atleast put in the effort to actually check all your damn boxes next time because according to other reviews it's a damn lottery for what you get when you order these.,Apple,iPhone12Pro,60,P,0.132,0.821,0.047,-0.8396,N

"I’ll preface this review by saying I am pretty picky when it comes to my possessions.  My IPhone 7+ finally gave up the ghost.  I was hoping to get through the remainder of this year so that when the IPhone 15 came out that I would get a renewed 14 Max Pro but that was not to be.  We had purchased a renewed IPhone 12 for my son from another seller and were surprised with how clean it was when it arrived.  We paid extra for the excellent condition and it was in pristine condition with a 100% battery max battery health.Prime day comes along and I see this phone from this seller.  It was roughly $200 more than the regular IPhone 12 that we bought for my son but it was the Pro model and it did have 512k of storage.  Due to the positive experience we had with the earlier purchase, I decided to pull the trigger.Fulfillment was great.  I had ordered the phone on 7/11 and it was scheduled to arrive on 7/14 but to my surprise it hit my house on 7/13 which was a nice surprise.When I picked up the package I got worried because I could hear and feel something rattling in the box that was shipped in a form fitting padded envelope.  To my relief I found the phone  to be intact.  It arrived with protective plastic on the screen, a SIM port tool, and a lightning charging cable that was loose in the box.  Upon inspection I found the screen to be free of scratches or gouges but there is some slight surface marring on a small section of the screen that you have to look for in order to see.  The bezel was clean except for a couple of nicks.  The worst sign of usage is a chip above the top of the highest camera lens.  It’s not huge but you can definitely see it and it looks like a chip in a car windshield since the back of the phone is finished in glass.  The only other thing to mention is that there was a bit of what looks like green metal tape that was poking out of the side of the phone between the screen and bezel which I was able to rub off with my fingernail.  It looked like the refurb process was not as clean as it could have been.Going into the settings I found that the max battery life was only 85% which was kind of a bummer.  Setting up the phone was a breeze with ICloud but I haven’t figured out how to pull down the pictures that resided on my old phone.  My apps came over but know I had to re-enter my passwords in most cases.After only a couple of day usage, everything seems to work fine.  Amazon gives 90 days to return for any issues.  The camera on the pro is a definite improvement over the 7+.  Size wise the unit is smaller than the 7+ but the screen is bigger on the 12 since it doesn’t have the home button at the bottom which I keep wanting to press out of habit.Overall the purchase was better than ok.  If the phone has another 10% of battery life and the nick on the camera was not present then I would rate the item as excellent.  I’ll always wonder if I should have purchased a phone from the other seller that sold a phone in perfect condition.  I will update this review should anything major happen with the phone.",Apple,iPhone12Pro,80,P,0.032,0.836,0.132,0.9967,P
"I was a little hesitant to buy a ""Renewed"" phone, but I am so glad I did. This iPhone 12 Pro arrived in excellent condition. I looked it over under a bright light and couldn't find a single scratch on the screen or the Graphite back.The battery health is solid (over 85%), and it holds a charge easily through the whole day. Setup was a breeze since it came fully unlocked—I just popped in my SIM card and it worked immediately. The cameras are amazing, and the phone is fast. If you're on the fence about saving money versus buying new, I highly recommend going this route. Great value!",Apple,iPhone12Pro,80,P,0.01,0.72,0.27,0.9904,P

"This is my third purchase of a renewed iPhone from the Amazon Renewed Store. They are such a great value compared to a new phone. My latest purchase looked brand new, and had 96% of its original battery capacity, suggesting that the battery had been replaced in the renewal process since iPhone 12 Pro production stopped 4 years ago. Included in the box were a charging cord (USB C to Fire) and a SIM card tray tool. It took less than 30 minutes to mirror the data and apps from my older iPhone 12 Pro to the new one via WiFi.I kept my previously-purchased iPhone 12 Pro to use as a mobile hotspot (I live in a rural area without broadband). It is still working fine except that the side button no longer functions after 2 years of daily hard use in my *very* dusty environment (no protective case). There are easy workarounds for the lack of side button (power off with Siri or in Settings; power on by plugging into charger; update or install apps with a change in Settings), but I retired my iPhone 8 hotspot (still working flawlessly  after being purchased from the Amazon Renewed Store 6 years ago) because it no longer is supported by the current iOS, making it incompatible with some updated apps that I use heavily (e.g., Substack).Listen to the Andrew Yang podcast ""The Hidden Cost Of Your 'Free' Phone"" to get an idea of how much money you save by buying a refurb.",Apple,iPhone12Pro,100,P,0.038,0.866,0.096,0.9377,P
"happy i purchased this when i did. the phone came pretty quickly , overnight actually! looked good right out the box, turned on and functions pretty well , no complaints. my only concern was the battery percentage was at 80%, which to be fair was indicated on the site. but it started deteriorating pretty quickly in terms of screen on time and needing to recharge quite often. anyway eventually i ended up buying a new battery from an apple store and still have the phone until now. no complaints otherwise, it does what its supposed to do. now that i've bought a new battery guess i'll have to keep it for atleast another year just for the purchase to make sense. thats just me though.",Apple,iPhone12Pro,100,P,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.9502,P
